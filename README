DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::Serializer::JSYNC

This is basically the only serialization backend I could find that
wasn't "Dumper()", and actually seemed to work with arbitrary "bless()"

    package Foo::Result::Thing;
    __PACKAGE__->load_components('InflateColumn::Serializer', 'Core');
    __PACKAGE__->table('thing');

    ....

    __PACKAGE__->add_column(
        data => {
            data_type => 'text',
            serializer_class => 'JSYNC',
        }
    );
